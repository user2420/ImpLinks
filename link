Of course! Here’s another reel-style version—this one is edgier, fast-paced, and hooks the viewer with more urgency:

🎥 [Opening: Flashing words on screen, glitchy effect — “STRESSED?” “FORGOTTEN?” “BURNED OUT?”]

🎙️ Voiceover / Text on screen:

"This isn't just stress.
It's chronic stress.
Wrecking your sleep.
Messing with your memory.
Turning your brain into static.
You’re anxious, exhausted,
forgetting names,
avoiding people—
and you don’t even know why."

⚠️ [Cut to visual of brain on fire or digital overload]

"This is your mind screaming for help.
And no, grinding through it isn’t strength—
It’s self-destruction."

💥 [Shift: Bold text]

"Take the break.
Set the boundary.
Reclaim your mind.
Because burnout isn’t a badge—
it’s a warning."

🎵 [Drop music – empowering beat kicks in]
📢 "It’s time to RESET."
